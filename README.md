## gHomes allows your players to rent/purchase houses or apartments.

GHomes is provided with strong and easy-to-use tools which will allow you to quickly add -if the map you're using is not supported yet- houses or apartments to your favorite map.

You can either buy/rent the home/apartment directly on it's front panel or go to the NPC selling them, you can also disable the panels in the config to force the players to use the Seller.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) Sexy booting animation for the tool (you'll see it only once, don't worry)

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) **[NEW]** You can now edit houses (daily price, perma price, name etc) directly with the NPC

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) **[NEW]** Players can now rent houses in hours not just in days

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) **[NEW]** You can enable the "sell-on-leave" mode to get a darkrp vanilla experience and still make it easier for your players to buy houses

Even if the tool to add homes is easy as hell to use, [ready-to use maps files](https://i.imgur.com/7YyTCFL.png) are provided with the addon, more will come in the future, but keep in mind using [the tools](https://youtu.be/oD2ZUGqk5_M) is really easy.

All existing map are supported, there is nothing as an "unsupported map", the tools are easy as fuck to use, really

(I know it's supposed to be X per day and not per day**s**, it's fixed in the addon but i'm too lazy to re-record it)

_sexy booting animation which you will see only once ;), don't worry about seeing it evertime to use the tool_
